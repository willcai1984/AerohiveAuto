    <brief>Channel scan process on wifi0 or wifi1 which is in sensor mode</brief>
    <brief>Scan all the supported channels on wifi1 which is in sensor mode</brief>
    <priority>Accept</priority>
    <automated>yes</automated>
    <description>
    Pre-Condition:
        Config wifi0 as sensor mode
    	Config wifi1 as sensor mode

        Test Procedure:

    	1. Check mode of wifi0
    	2. Customize the channel list
    	3. Check channel scan process in log
