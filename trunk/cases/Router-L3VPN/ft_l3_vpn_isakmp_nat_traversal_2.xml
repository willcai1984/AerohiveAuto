		Pre-Condition:

			

		Test Procedure:

			1.	If the responder has to rekey the Phase 1 SA, then the rekey negotiation 
			MUST be started by using UDP(4500,Y). Any implementation that supports 
			NAT traversal MUST support negotiations that begin on port 4500. If a 
			negotiation starts on port 4500, then it doesn't need to change anywhere 
			else in the exchange.
			2.	Verify the result rekey happen in phase II and NAT is supported.
