		Pre-Condition:

			

		Test Procedure:

			1.	Implementations MUST support certificates that contain more than a 
			single identity, such as when the Subject field and the SubjectAltName 
			extension are both populated, or the SubjectAltName extension contains 
			multiple identities irrespective of whether or not the Subject is empty. In 
			many cases, a certificate will contain an identity, such as an IP address, 
			in the SubjectAltName extension in addition to a non-empty Subject
			2.	Verify that the valid date of the server certification is out of the current 
			date then authentication fails
			3.	Verify that the valid date of the CA is out of the current date then the 
			authentication fails.
			4.	Verify that authentication fails when the CA mismatch with service 
			certification.
			5.	Verify that authentication fails when the service certification mismatch 
			with private key.
			6.	Verify that packet can be deal with correctly when service certification is 
			large(such as more than 1500 bytes total)
			7.	Verify that authentication fail when CA or server certification or private 
			key are not stored.
			8.	The upper step need be performed in both side when auth-mode is rsa-sig
