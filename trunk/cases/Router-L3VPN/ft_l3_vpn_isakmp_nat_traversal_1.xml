    <description>
        
		Pre-Condition:

			

		Test Procedure:

			1.	The Vendor ID of NAT-Traversal is contained in the first exchange.
			2.	The NAT-D payload is contained in the second exchange.
			3.	Ports are not be changed to 4500 and Non-ESP Marker is not attached to 
			the packets  in the third exchange when there is not NAT in the middle.
			4.	Both Ports is changed to 4500 in initiator. In addition, the IKE data MUST 
			be prepended with a non-ESP marker allowing for demultiplexing of trffic.
			5.	When NAT-Traversal is supported in box but NAT exist between remote 
			and gateway. Ipsec SA can be created but Data traffic broken.
			6.	"The NAT-D payload not only detects the presence of NAT between the 
			two IKE peers, but also detects where the NAT is. The location of the NAT 
			device is important, as the keepalives have to initiate from the peer 
			"behind" the NAT" so place NAT device in different place to verify the 
			initiator of the keepalive.
